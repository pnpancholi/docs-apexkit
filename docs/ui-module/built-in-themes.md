# Daisy UI: Built-in themes

### Beautiful UIs, Built in Minutes
This starter ships with Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI pre-configured and ready to go — the perfect combo for developers who want speed without sacrificing beauty or flexibility.

1. The Power Duo: Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI
Wide ecosystem
You’re not starting from scratch. You’re plugged into the massive Tailwind ecosystem — thousands of plugins, component libraries, templates, and tutorials. Daisy UI sits on top and adds production-ready, accessible components (buttons, cards, modals, drawers, dropdowns, tables, and more) that follow Tailwind’s utility-first philosophy. Whatever you need, the community has already solved it.
Lightning-fast development
Stop writing the same button styles over and over. Daisy UI gives you clean, semantic classes like btn btn-primary, card, drawer, navbar, hero — all fully responsive and dark-mode ready out of the box.
Build pixel-perfect interfaces 3–5× faster than plain Tailwind, while keeping 100% control. No magic, no bloat — just pure Tailwind under the hood.

2. Instant Visual Appeal with Built-in Themes
Why ship another boring gray-and-blue app?
Daisy UI comes with 20+ gorgeous themes (light, dark, pastel, cyberpunk, luxury, corporate, and more) that you can switch with a single class or data attribute.

Pick a theme in seconds and your entire app looks polished and modern instantly.
It’s the sweet spot between “ugly default starter” and “heavy design-system overhead”.
No Figma-to-code nightmares. No months of design debt.

When your team or client is ready, simply progressively evolve it:

Start with any built-in theme
Tweak a few variables and thats it
Replace with your company’s full branding (colors, typography, logos, custom components) progressively
Keep using the same Daisy UI classes — everything just adapts.

Zero lock-in. Total freedom.
