# Getting Started

Let's get you started on your "next" venture.

1.  Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pnpancholi/apexkit
    ```
2.  Install dependencies (use your preferred package manager):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Voilà! That's all you need to get started.
