These are repetitive tasks that slow you down when speed is everything.</p> <p>But rapid prototyping shouldn’t come at the cost of performance, scalability, or future flexibility. Many \"quick-start\" solutions sacrifice performance, trap you in vendor ecosystems, or leave behind technical debt that becomes expensive — in both time and money — the moment your project gains traction. Suddenly, you’re stuck refactoring, migrating, or paying for subscriptions that don’t truly help you grow.</p> <p>ApexKit gives you the best of both worlds: the velocity of indie hacking and the clean, scalable foundation that production apps (and serious businesses) need from day one. </p>","path":["Introduction"],"tags":[]},{"location":"#whats-inside","level":4,"title":"What’s inside","text":"<ul> <li>Next.js 15 (App Router + React Server Components)</li> <li>Drizzle ORM : type-safe, SQL, and flexible enough to works with database solution of your choice. </li> <li>Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI – beautiful and accessible UI out of the box</li> <li>Better Auth : Fine-tuned, vendor-agnostic authentication</li> <li>Full TypeScript support</li> <li>Production-ready patterns for authentication and authorization. </li> </ul>","path":["Introduction"],"tags":[]},{"location":"#ready-to-give-it-a-try-get-started","level":4,"title":"Ready to give it a try ?

Some developers are perfectly happy (and productive) with MongoDB; others wouldn’t touch a non-relational database with a ten-foot pole. Some swear JavaScript has no place on the back-end; others run profitable, and secure businesses on it every day.</p> <p>That same spectrum exists when choosing a starter kit.

A JavaScript developer who understands where Node.JS can be notorious for memory leaks is just as safe as a seasoned Rust engineer who knows the same about their language (yes, you can still leak memory in Rust). Strong opinions come from real-world experience. They act as guardrails that keep most projects secure and stable by default.</p>","path":["Introduction"],"tags":[]},{"location":"#speed-that-actually-ships-products","level":4,"title":"Speed That Actually Ships Products","text":"<p>It’s incredibly easy and fun to chase the next hot framework or CSS library. I did it constantly in college: one assignment in React, the next in Vue, then Angular, then Gatsby. Curiosity and experimentation are how we grow as developers.</p> <p>But when you’re building something real — especially as a solo founder, small team, or side-project warrior with a day job—that mindset becomes expensive. Trying the shiny new thing might feel exciting, but it rarely helps you ship faster or sleep better at night.</p> <p>I wouldn’t reach for an experimental stack when helping a friend launch a platform for independent journalists on nights and weekends. Tempting? Absolutely. Responsible? Not even close.</p> <p>Some opinions of this project, briefly: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Drizzle ORM. </p> <p>Getting really good with a lightweight, type-safe ORM like Drizzle is a far better long-term investment than tying your data layer to platform-specific SDKs (Supabase, Firebase, Clerk, etc.). Those SDKs often create hidden problems:</p> <ul> <li>Painful refactoring when you outgrow or switch platforms</li> <li>Forced rewrites after breaking changes</li> <li>Vendor lock-in because migrating later costs more in time and opportunity than staying stuck</li> </ul> <p>With Drizzle, you own your schema and queries. You stay portable, type-safe, and in full control — no surprises when your project takes off.  2.  TypeScript</p> <p>Many developers have a love-hate relationship with JavaScript’s type system. You can go fully untyped, use JSDoc, or embrace TypeScript in various ways. ApexKit chooses full TypeScript because it can be adopted progressively, catches entire classes of bugs at compile time, and dramatically reduces runtime crashes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Better Auth</p> <p>Authentications and authorization are among the most crucial parts of any application. You need both and they need to be secure. With Better Auth, we get to roll a secure authentication system without being stuck with a vendor. We can own our data, set up backups that fit the business needs, and focus on building meaningful features. </p> <p>And with ApexKit, you do not have to worry about setting it up from scratch. All you have to do is provide a database connection, and you have a working authentication with sign-up, sign-in, reset password, email verification, magic links and even your transaction emails. And you can always extend for OTPs and two-factor authentication easily with Better Auth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stability</p> <p>Apexkit is built for stability, and easy management. Refactoring doesn't need to break everything. Stability means being battle-tested and having the flexibility to evolve. Just like JavaScript, there are new UI frameworks being launched every day. But we use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to keep the project stable. You get a solid community, flexibility to build your own components with Tailwind, and speed of DaisyUI to get started quick. You get the stability of Better Auth's battle-tested auth system, flexibility of owning your data, and speed of Better Auth plugins to add more security features.</p> </li> </ol>","path":["Introduction"],"tags":[]}]}
